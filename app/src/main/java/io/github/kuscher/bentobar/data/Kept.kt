/**
 * Small texts that stay on this install: a service's last answer, so that a restart can show it
 * without asking again. They live under Android's no-backup directory, which the system leaves out
 * of cloud backups and device-to-device transfers, and they are no part of the layout, so Copy
 * settings never carries them.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin (plain files), unit-tested on the JVM. Reading and writing touch the disk: do it from a
 * background load, not from an item's state.
 *
 * Never keep a service's reply as it came: a flight service's reply repeats the key it was asked
 * with. Keep your own model, serialized, which cannot hold what you did not put into it.
