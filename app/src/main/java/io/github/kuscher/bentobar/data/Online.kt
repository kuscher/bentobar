/**
 * Whether BentoBar may ask an online service, and the user's own key for one that needs it. Three
 * items go online, Weather, Flight and Stocks, and each only after the user set it up on this install:
 * that is what [turnOn] and [saveKey] record, and [turnOff] takes back.
 *
 * All of it belongs to this install and never travels. It is kept in one small file in Android's
 * no-backup directory, beside the layout but no part of it: a pasted layout, a restored backup and a
 * device transfer bring neither a switch nor a key. A key never leaves this object except through
 * [key], for the one request that needs it; it is in no state, no log and no string.
