 * Seen on 6 October 2026, for a number that flies more than once a day (UA 1227): `flight` is not
 * the nearest of its flights. With the one from Newark late and due in a quarter of an hour it answered
 * with the evening's from San Francisco, and once Newark's was in the air with a mix of the two:
 * Newark's airports and position, San Francisco's times, gates and belt. It takes no airport to narrow
 * it down. `schedules` had each flight as it was, the one in the air too.
 *
 * Every reply repeats the key it was asked with (and names the caller's address) in a `request`
