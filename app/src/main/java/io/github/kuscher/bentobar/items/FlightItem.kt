/**
 * Flight: follows one flight, whose number the user enters in the item's menu. The bar counts down to
 * its departure with the gate, then to its landing, and says when it runs late; the times come from
 * AirLabs, with a key of the user's own. One of the two item types that go online ([online]), and
 * only once a key was saved on this install.
 *
 * Where things are: what a flight is doing is [FlightRules]' to say, the words are [FlightText]'s, the
 * requests and what is kept [FlightLoad]'s, the menu and the key's settings are in `FlightMenu.kt`.
 * This object holds them together: the loader for what each item follows ([tracker]: nothing is
 * scheduled, a flight is asked about when its item is looked at and its answer has grown old), the
 * one lookup at a time for a press of Track ([search]), whose flight is taken as it comes or, where
 * the number flies more than once that day, once the menu was told which ([choose]), and what a test
 * stages in their place.
 *
 * The key is `Online`'s. It is read in [FlightLoad], for the request, and is in no state, no
 * description, no tooltip and nothing a debug hook prints.
