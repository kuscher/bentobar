/**
 * The Flight item's requests, and what it keeps. Everything here runs on a background thread (a
 * `Refresher`'s load and restore, an `Ask`'s work) except [take] and [stop], which are the user's own
 * act in the menu and touch two small files.
 *
 * What leaves the device: the flight number and the user's own key, to airlabs.co, and nothing else.
 * Never without a key, never while the service is switched off: asked here before any request, though
 * the request code would refuse too.
 *
 * What is kept, by the item's id and outside the layout (so in no backup and no copied settings):
 * what the item follows (the number, the day that flight leaves and the airport it leaves from) as
 * the feature's own note, and the last answer as [Tracked] with what the service sent. Switching the
 * service off deletes the answers and keeps the notes; removing the key deletes both. The key itself
 * is `Online`'s: it is read here for the one request that needs it and goes into nothing that is
 * kept, shown or said.
