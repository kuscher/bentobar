 * Flights for looking at the item in each of its states without waiting for a real one to be in it
 * (debug builds: `./bento debug flight show NAME`). Each is made for the moment it is staged at, so
 * that it reads as its name says then; the staged clock (`./bento debug now +30m`) moves it on from
 * there. Nothing of a sample is asked of the flight service, and none needs a key.
 *
 * The flight is the examples' LH 455, San Francisco to Frankfurt, with made-up times. Where several
 * flights are to choose from it is UA 1227, which flies three times a day, with its timetable's times.
