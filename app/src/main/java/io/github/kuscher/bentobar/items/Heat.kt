/**
 * How hot Android says the device is, in one place for the Heat item and for the CPU item's rule:
 * the thermal status, the battery's temperature and the heat level, each as Android reports it or as
 * a test staged it (debug builds: `./bento debug heat stage 3`), so that a staged status moves both
 * items.
 *
 * The status and the temperature are the battery sampler's readings; the ticker takes them for the
 * types that name that sampler in their `samples`. The one thing asked here is the heat level, and
 * only from [sample], which is the Heat item's once-a-second call while one is live.
