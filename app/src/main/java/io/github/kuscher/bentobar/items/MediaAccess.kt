/**
 * BentoBar's entry in Android's "Notification access" list, and nothing more. It exists for one
 * reason: Android tells an app what the media players are playing (their sessions: title, artist,
 * artwork) only if the user has turned that app on in this list. BentoBar wants the sessions and no
 * notifications. So the manifest entry asks for no notification type, marks all four types as never
 * wanted (Android's page for the listener shows them off and disabled), and tells Android not to
 * bind this service by itself. It reads nothing: a notification that reached it all the same would
 * only be counted ([received]), for the test that proves none does.
 *
 * Reading sessions needs the listener to be turned on, not to be running, so normally this class is
 * never even created. Should a device insist on a running listener, [NowPlaying] asks for it to be
 * bound once ([bind]) and lets it go again when no Now playing item needs it ([release]).
 *
 * Everything about notification access is in this one file: Now playing still works without it (an
 * icon and the media keys), and without the manifest entry [granted] is simply never true.
