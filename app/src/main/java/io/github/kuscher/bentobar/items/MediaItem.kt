 * controls in its menu. The source is [NowPlaying], which runs only while an item of this type is
 * live ([onLive], [onIdle]) and knows the players' titles only with notification access; without it
 * the item still shows that something plays and controls it with the media keys.
 *
 * What the bar and the menu say is decided in [MediaText] (pure, tested); the menu and the options
 * are drawn in `MediaMenu.kt`. A title, an artist and artwork are only ever in memory: nothing of a
 * player is written, logged or put into the layout, and this object itself keeps no title, only
 * when something last played and which app that was.
